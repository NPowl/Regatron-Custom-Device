# Regatron Custom Device
 Repo for creating a VeriStand Custom Device for Regatron G5 devices.

To use - clone the "Built" folder. There are 2020 and 2021 releases in this folder.
Copy the internal "G5 Regatron Custom Device" folder into "C:\Users\Public\Documents\National Instruments\NI VeriStand 202X\Custom Devices\G5 Regatron Custom Device", replacing X with your VeriStand version.


> **Important:**  Install the "HTTP Client with SSL Support" package on the NI Real-Time target using NI MAX. Without this package the deployment will fail!
